# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Environment Configuration Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Iteration 1 - 2025-10-09**:

✅ **Content Quality**: All sections are properly focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW. No frameworks, languages, or technical implementation details present.

✅ **Requirement Completeness**:
- All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable (time-based, percentage-based, count-based)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific tools/frameworks)
- User scenarios include detailed acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (6 scenarios)
- Scope is bounded with clear "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions and dependencies clearly documented

✅ **Feature Readiness**:
- All functional requirements map to user scenarios
- 3 prioritized user stories cover the primary flows (P1: core switching, P2: configuration management, P3: verification)
- Each user story is independently testable
- No implementation details present in the spec

**Conclusion**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`) or optional clarification phase (`/speckit.clarify`).
